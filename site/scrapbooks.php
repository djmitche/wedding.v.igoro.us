      <p>We would like to commemorate our wedding by inviting guests to make a
      page for our scrapbook!  A page could be anything you want--written
      thoughts, a photo collage, a story, a poem--whatever.  All this will
      happen at the <a href="/schedule.php">rehearsal dinner</a>.

      <ul>
        <li>We'll supply basic materials
        <li>You bring whatever photographs, etc. you have (or copies thereof if you want to keep the original)
        <li>Or, easier still, send us digital images ahead of time and we'll make them available
        <li>If you have lots of photos, bring/send some to share
        <li>We will collate the pages and display the finished scrapbook at the reception
      </ul>
 
      <p>If you want to send us digital pictures, need help getting photos copied,
      or are confused in any way, please contact dustin@cs.uchicago.edu

      <p>If you have no photos, or just don't want to participate, we hope you
      will still come to eat and keep us company
